# About Pet Feed #
Pet Feed is an original automatic pet feeding sensing device. We believe that development
should come into our lives and facilitate it for a long time. Therefore, several properties and
descriptions of our project:

* A simple, fast working mechanism that will pour the right amount of feed.
* An accurate sensor for responding to a pet approaching the unit.
* Convenient design and size.
* Expressive, intuitive instructions for use.
* Reliable stable buildings made of plastic.
Pet Feed will be an affordable, quality feeder for your pets.

## The constituent parts of Pet Feed ##

Pet Feed has the most comfortable construction design. From the code files you can see how
carefully we have written our codes in order to show you how our device is built.

1. In the image above, you can see the complete assembled design of our feeder, consisting
of a box, spindle and a connecting part, the mechanical part that will open and close,
thereby pouring the right amount of feed.
2. In this image you will see the part called - the Box. It consists of a space in the form of a
circle for pouring feed; it is deepened inward so that the feed does not scatter around.
Also in the figure you will see that we assembled this structure separately, preserving
each part.
3. Here we show the upper part of the structure – the Spindle, the part where the feed will
be contained before the device pours it down. Here we show the upper part of the
structure - the Funnel, the part where the feed will be contained before the device pours it
down. Also, the first picture you can see how this part was created, being initially only a
roller. Further, the structure was changed, in order to accommodate more feed.
4. The connecting part, in which you can also approximately see the hole where the pet food
will be spilled out.
5. And the inside of our apparatus, including a servo, an ultrasonic sensor and an Arduino^1.
the Site through which the inside was made is licensed.
6. The mechanical part that will open and close, thereby pouring the right amount of feed.
